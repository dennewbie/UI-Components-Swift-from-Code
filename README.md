# UI Components Swift from Code

In this xCode project I created most of the UI Component such as:
  - Buttons
  - ImageView
  - Slider
  - Timer
  - TextFields
  - Navigation Bar
  - Label
  - Navigation Scheme
  - WebView
  - Activity Indicator
  - Custom Navigation Bar


Furthermore, you will find also how to pass data (String and others) in different ways.
Hope it can help! :)
